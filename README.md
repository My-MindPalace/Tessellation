# Tessellation
Description
    A Tessellation (or Tiling) is the act of covering a surface with a pattern of flat shapes so that there are no overlaps or gaps.
    Tessellations express fascinating geometric and symmetric properties as art,
    and famously appear in Islamic art with four, five, and six-fold regular tessellations.
